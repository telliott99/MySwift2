Introduction

This is an introductory book about writing programs in the Swift programming language.

There are many other sources of information about Swift, including the language guide, a new book from Big Nerd Ranch (I don't like the verbosity of the examples in the book, but the depth of coverage is good):

a fairly advanced book that I like quite a bit:

and of course, there is also a lot of material to choose from online.

My primary motivation in writing this book, as with my other ones, is to improve my own knowledge.  Nevertheless, I believe these words may have some value to you.

I aim to be both concise and clear.  One of my favorite programming books is Stroustrup's *The C++ programming language* and I follow his lead in using the simplest possible examples (and labels for variables within those examples).  While not recommended for real-world code, this sparse presentation style makes leaves bare what is essential.

Second, I include some of my favorite examples in introductory computer science, and not just the Fibonacci numbers but encryption, prime numbers, working with binary data, and sorting algorithms.  As time goes on I hope to add more.

Finally, I'll just mention that I find it really painful to read long code examples in other books.  I usually just skim them and try to write my own version.  I expect you will probably do the same.

Enjoy the book!
