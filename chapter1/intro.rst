Introduction

This is an introductory book about writing programs in the Swift programming language.

There are many other sources of information about Swift, including the language guide, and a new book from Big Nerd Ranch, as well as a fairly advanced book that I like quite a bit.  There is a lot of material to choose from online.

My primary motivation in writing this book, as with my other books, is to improve my own knowledge of the subject.  Nevertheless, I believe it may have some value to you.

First, I aim to be both concise and clear.  One of my favorite books is Stroustrup's *The C++ programming language* and I follow his lead in using the simplest possible labels for examples.  While not recommended for real-world code, this sparse presentation makes plain what is essential.

Second, I include some of my favorite examples in introductory computer science, and not just the Fibonacci numbers but encryption, prime numbers, working with binary data, and sorting algorithms.

I hope you enjoy it.
