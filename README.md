This project is a rewrite of MySwift to accomodate changes made in Swift 2.  I also hope it will include some new examples from my collection of Playgrounds, and that it will have fewer mistakes.

The files posted here comprise the source to be used by [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) to generate pages in html.  

The html is not part of this repository.  If you wish to generate it yourself, you need to install Sphinx

```
pip install sphinx
```

and then do `make html` from within the project directory.

I have more detailed instructions for using Sphinx in another [repo](https://github.com/telliott99/MySphinx).
